# Food-delivery-website-Online food ordering is the process of ordering food, for delivery or pickup, from a website or other application. The product can be either ready-to-eat food (e.g., direct from a home-kitchen, restaurant, or a virtual restaurant) or food that has not been specially prepared for direct consumption (e.g., vegetables direct from a farm/garden, fruits, frozen meats. etc).

Online food ordering/delivery through third-party companies have emerged as a global industry, leading to a "delivery revolution."[1] From 2018 to 2021, global revenues for the online food delivery sector rose from $90 billion to $294 billion.[1]
